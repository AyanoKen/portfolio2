Would you believe me if I said I fell in love with something that might not exist? Okay, it logically does not exist, but to me, it does.

Not a girl I met at a bar or someone I passed on the subway. A memory that never happened and a beautiful lie stitched together by a tired mind.

I did not meet her in the way you meet someone, shake their hand, exchange names, talk about weather and books and dreams of leaving the city. No, this was different.

She came to me in pieces, sometimes in the corner of a sunlit room, sometimes walking barefoot along a path I had never seen before. Her voice reached me before her face did. And somehow, I recognized her before I even knew her name.

You could call it a dream. You could call it delusion. I am not sure I know the difference anymore.

What I do know is that when I close my eyes, I leave this world behind.. This brittle shell of deadlines, digital noise and elevator small talk and... and I wake up somewhere else. A different life. A different version of me.

One where I am twenty again.

Trust me. You don’t realize just how heavy time is until it’s stripped away. The first time I opened my eyes in that place, I thought it was just a dream stitched from old regrets and unmet desires. But the way the wind moved, the way my heart felt lighter, the way she looked at me… It wasn’t like a dream. It felt like a second chance.

I used to laugh at people who chased meaning in dreams. Used to think they were just sad, lonely people clinging to whatever scraps of beauty their minds would conjure.

And here I am, becoming just like that.

I know. I know that it is just my imagination. A narrative my exhausted brain plays to keep me from falling apart. But if that is true, then why do I remember every detail so vividly? Why does her absence ache like a missing limb when I wake up?

I never planned to get attached. It was just a break from reality, a breath of fresh air which I was happy about. But she changed that

She changed everything.

And now I am caught between two lives. One that pays my bills and drains my soul. Another that disappears every morning like dew in sunlight.

I have stopped telling myself it’s harmless.

This isn’t the beginning. By now I have already spent countless nights in that world. I have already memorized the shape of her smile, the scent of her hair, the sound of her laugh.

By now, I have already crossed a line I can’t uncross.

How did I end up like this here. I don’t know the answer myself. But let me take you back to when it all started.

I slept at 3:14 AM.

Not because I was up late binging something, or out with friends, or even enjoying my own damn company.

No, I was fixing a bug that didn’t matter. For a client I’d never meet. In a project I stopped caring about six months ago.

“High-priority something something issue.” That was the subject line probably. The kind of thing that feels urgent at 12:03 AM and irrelevant by sunrise.

I don’t even remember solving it. Just the hum of my laptop fan and the dead glow of my second monitor. The ticket got closed. The issue vanished along with my will to live.

But I stayed awake.

It’s not the kind of tired you can sleep off — the kind that seeps into your bones and convinces you there’s no point in dreaming at all.

This stays between us, but if you are someone who uses teams, always turn your status to offline as soon as clock hits 5pm. Trust me on this.

I woke up at 9:30 AM to my alarm screaming like it was furious I was still alive.

Dragged myself to the sink. Brushed my teeth like I was sanding down a wall. The mirror looked at me like a stranger, and I looked back with the same courtesy.

Showered. Got dressed. Didn’t eat. There wasn’t time, or hunger, or care.

By 10:00, I was out the door, slapping on deodorant like war paint as I walked.

The roads were chaos.
A hundred cars, honking and inching forward like insects. No one smiled. No one listened to music. Just hands gripping wheels and eyes staring ahead like we were all headed to the same funeral.

It took fifty-seven minutes to get to the office. Fifty-seven minutes of exhaust fumes, half-dead coffee, and news radio reminding me that everything was still falling apart.

At 10:59, I scanned my badge and walked into a building designed to look like it meant something.

Everything inside was beige and blue and dead.

The walls had posters about “innovation” and “teamwork” in fonts that screamed we had neither.

My floor smelled like printer toner and resignation.

The guy at the desk next to mine didn’t say good morning. He never did. His eyes were glued to code like it was a staring contest.

I sat down, opened my laptop, and disappeared into Jira tickets.

The hours bled together. Stand-up. Bug report. Lunch I didn’t taste.

By 3 PM, I couldn’t remember what I had done that morning. By 5 PM, I couldn’t tell if I’d actually spoken out loud.

Around 6, someone laughed at something — a dry, empty bark of a sound. I looked up, and for a moment I thought, maybe I imagined it.

My manager pinged me at 6:34:

“Any chance you can stay online a bit longer? Just in case the client has questions.”

I replied with a thumbs-up emoji, a polite way of saying: I don’t have the option to say no.

I left the office at 8:12. The janitor nodded at me like we shared a secret — the kind that only people who stay too late ever know.

Drove home in silence. Lights blurred past the window like streaks on a painting no one finished.

Microwave dinner. Another shower. Mindless scrolling.

I told myself I’d sleep early. I always told myself that.

But time didn’t move the same at night. It dragged. It lingered.

At 2:59 AM, I lay in bed, staring at the cracks in my ceiling like they might whisper back.

My eyes traced the lines until they blurred, like veins under pale skin. I used to think they were just part of the plaster. Now they felt like fractures in something deeper — the foundation, maybe. Of this apartment. Of my life.

I had done everything right. That’s what pisses me off the most.

I followed the damn blueprint. Study hard. Get good grades. Don’t party too much. Stay focused. Don’t fall in love — that’s a distraction. Don’t travel — that’s a waste of time. Don’t feel too much — that’s weakness.

And I didn’t.
I was obedient. Efficient. The perfect little machine.

While everyone else was getting drunk in dorm rooms, I was preparing for interviews. While people were skipping lectures to go hiking or dancing or fucking or feeling something, I was poring over Leetcode problems and memorizing frameworks like scripture.

I sacrificed everything.

And for what?

So I could wake up in a box, drive in a box, sit in a box, type into a box, then come home to another box and pretend I had made it.

They tell you it’ll all be worth it. That all the missed moments and sleepless nights will somehow pay off. That once you land the job, once you get the paycheck, once you hit “success,” everything will make sense.

But no one tells you how empty it feels when the only thing you’ve earned is silence.

No one tells you what it’s like to achieve everything and feel absolutely nothing.

I blinked, and the ceiling cracked a little more — or maybe it always looked like that.

I wondered what I missed.

The people I didn’t talk to because I was “too focused.” The parties I skipped because I had a test. The summer I said no to a road trip because I had an internship.

The life I never let myself live.

I thought about the old me — the version of myself that wanted to sing in the shower, flirt with strangers, get his heart broken, dance in the rain, and laugh so hard his stomach hurt.

I buried that guy.

I killed him to build this one.

But lately, when I close my eyes, I think I hear him again. Laughing. Whispering. Telling me it’s not too late.

I don’t know if it’s hope or hallucination.

But that night, just before 3:00 AM… I let myself believe.

I didn’t pray. I didn’t wish. I just gave in.

I let go of the version of me that was supposed to be.

And I fell.

I didn’t expect anything to change.

I didn’t expect meaning, or magic, or miracles.

I just closed my eyes.

And then…

Everything changed.
