It started with motion.

Wind against glass. The low hum of tires on asphalt. Light flickering through tree branches overhead, stuttering like an old film reel.

I wasn't driving. I wasn't even sure if I had a body.

But I could feel the road. I could feel the rhythm of it — the gentle pull when the car turned, the subtle vibration of music through the seat, the sensation of speed even though I couldn’t see the speedometer.

There was a voice beside me.

“You’re zoning out again.”

A girl. She had sharp eyes and a knowing smile, feet on the dashboard like she’d done it a thousand times before.

The driver laughed. “Am I?”

His voice startled me.
It was mine.
But it wasn’t me.

I heard it from inside, like being inside someone else’s memory.

“You think too much,” she said, unwrapping a mint and popping it into her mouth. “You’ll give yourself an ulcer before graduation.”

“Not if I crash first,” he said.

She rolled her eyes. “You are not funny.”

I wanted to speak. To stop him. To say something — anything — about how wrong it all felt. But I couldn’t.

I was a passenger in someone else’s life. A ghost behind the eyes of a version of myself I didn’t recognize.

The road curved. The sky above glowed a warm, late-afternoon orange. Shadows grew long across the pavement.

“This shortcut’s gonna save us like, what, ten minutes?” she asked.

“Fifteen if I floor it,” he said.

I felt the pedal sink. The engine roared louder.

My heart — or his heart — thumped harder.

Something wasn’t right.

The light through the windshield flickered again, but this time it didn’t look like trees. It looked like something blocking the sun.

“Wait—”

She sat up suddenly, pulling her feet down.

In the distance, a curve tightened sharply. Too sharp. A shape ahead — headlights? No. A barrier.

The tires squealed.

His hands twisted the wheel.

The girl shouted something I couldn’t hear.

Then —

Silence.

Not the kind of silence that comes after a crash. The kind that happens just before. The air sucked out of the world, the quiet before glass shatters, before metal bends, before time unravels.

And in that stillness, I knew —

This was how he died.

The me-that-wasn’t-me.

I was inside the last moments of a life that should have ended.

The world didn’t shatter all at once.

It peeled apart in pieces, slowly, as if time slowed down.

First came the sound — an unholy scream of rubber against road, shrill and hopeless. The tires fought for grip, scraping the curve like claws against tile.

Then the blur — trees turning into streaks, sky and ground swapping places in frantic flashes. I couldn’t tell if we were spinning or if the world was.

Our hands gripped the wheel tight. Too tight.

There was a scream. Hers.

Not loud. Not cinematic. Not the kind of scream they write into movies. It was a raw sound. Human. Cut short by impact.

Then the first crunch — metal folding like paper. The seatbelt jerked hard across his chest, his skull slamming sideways into the window. A starburst of pain lit up behind the eyes I didn’t own.

And for a second — just a second — it went quiet again.

The car lifted. I felt it. The sudden weightlessness. Tires no longer on the ground. That awful, impossible moment of floating.

And then gravity remembered us.

We landed hard.

The windshield exploded in a thousand glittering shards. Something snapped in the front axle — maybe a bone, maybe steel, I couldn’t tell anymore. The dashboard caved in. The passenger seat bent inward.

I wanted to close my eyes.

But I couldn’t.

The smell of gasoline filled the air. Burnt rubber. Blood.

My chest — his chest — wouldn’t rise properly. A crushing pressure pinned him there.

“Nngh—”

A cough. Wet. Rattling. A trickle of warmth sliding down his lip. Blood.

He looked sideways.

The girl.

She wasn’t moving.

Her head tilted awkwardly, mouth slightly open, hair plastered across her face.

Eyes closed.

And for a horrible second, I couldn’t tell if she was asleep or—

“No...”

His hand — my hand — reached toward her, trembling.

Fingers grazed her shoulder.

She didn’t flinch.

“Hey,” he whispered, barely audible, choking on the word. “Hey, wake up...”

Nothing.

His vision blurred.

Blood in his eye. Or maybe tears.

The world began to spin again — not violently this time, but slowly, as if the scene itself was fading out.

Trees. Smoke. Distant sirens?

Or just memory.

You’re not supposed to be here, I thought.

This isn’t your life.

But it felt like mine.

Every second of it.

His lungs rattled.

Not like a breath, but like a bag slowly collapsing. Each inhale shallower than the last. His chest barely moved. The weight pressing down on it felt like a cinderblock soaked in regret.

His eyes — my eyes — fluttered. One refused to open all the way. The other caught fractured shapes through broken glass: a tree. The curb. The smear of taillights in the distance.

But the girl.

She hadn’t moved.

Her skin was too pale now. Lips parted. Hair tangled across her cheek like some cruel veil.

He stared at her like he was trying to memorize everything in the last seconds he had.

His hand rested on her arm. Gently. Not shaking her. Not calling her name. Just... holding on.

The sounds around him faded — the whine of metal, the far-off drone of cars, even the sirens (if there ever were any) — they all blurred into silence.

His vision narrowed.

The edges darkened.

A sharp ache pressed into the side of his ribs, then softened, then dulled completely.

He looked up one last time — at the sky through the shattered windshield. It was turning violet, like the end of a sunset or the beginning of something else entirely.

And then…

He closed his eyes.

And I opened mine.

I gasped — breath sharp and sudden, like breaking the surface of a deep, dark pool.

My heart was hammering. My sheets were twisted, drenched in sweat. My throat burned.

It was still dark. My phone buzzed faintly on the nightstand — probably close to morning, but not there yet.

I sat up. Pressed a hand to my chest.

I was alive.

Of course I was.

But that dream — no, that death — had felt so real. I could still feel the weight of the seatbelt. The sting in my temple. The taste of blood at the back of my throat.

And worse than all of it, I could still feel her silence.

I staggered to the sink and splashed water on my face. Cold. Grounding.

It was just a dream.

It had to be.

But when I looked up at the mirror, I didn’t see the usual exhaustion. I saw something else.

Grief.

For a girl I didn’t know.
For a body I didn’t own.

And somewhere deep beneath it, something else stirred.

A flicker.

Like the first breath after drowning.

I didn’t know what that dream meant.

I didn’t know what it was.

But I knew one thing with terrifying certainty.

That wasn’t the last time I’d see him.

Or her.
