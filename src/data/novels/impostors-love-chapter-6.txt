I woke to stillness.

No blaring alarm. No ceiling fan. No gray light bleeding through the curtains.

Just warmth.
Soft sheets.
Faint birdsong beyond a window I hadn’t heard in days.

My eyes stayed closed.

Because this wasn’t possible.

Because I had let it go. Had accepted it. Told myself it was over, that it wasn’t real, that it couldn’t be real. That was the rule, right? You don’t get to lose something and then just… find it waiting.

But I knew this bed.

I knew the scent of lemon and dust in the air.

I knew the quiet hum of the fridge, the faint buzz of the window light.

I opened my eyes.

The same ceiling. The same cheap fan that never turned.
My phone on the nightstand, still at 23% battery.
The mug with the faint stain.
The crumpled hoodie on the back of the chair.

Exactly how I’d left it.

Time hadn’t moved.

This world — this place — had been waiting.

I sat up slowly, as if movement might break the illusion.

My heart was hammering, but everything else was still. The kind of stillness you only feel once — when you’re alone, but the silence doesn’t feel empty. When it feels like something is watching. Or listening.

And then—

Tears.

Not sobs. No broken voice. Just… wetness on my face.

I touched my cheek, confused. Blinked. Another tear slid down.

Why was I crying?

This wasn’t real.

This was just a dream. Just something my mind stitched together from want and regret and exhaustion. It didn’t deserve this kind of grief. Or relief. Or whatever this feeling was crawling out of me like something long buried finally remembered how to breathe.

I sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor, hands hanging between my knees.

The air was warm. The world was quiet.

And I didn’t move.

Because if I did, if I stood up and started walking, I might admit to myself what I already knew:

That I wasn’t happy to be back.
That I was relieved.
That this place — this impossible fragment of a life — meant more to me than anything I had left behind.
And I didn’t even know why.


I moved slowly.

Every step felt like testing the edge of a frozen lake — like the floor might vanish beneath me if I trusted it too much.

I touched the wall first. Just placed my hand flat against it. Rough paint. A little cool.

Then the doorframe. The table. The chipped mug still sitting near the sink.

All of it was just… here.

Not a memory. Not a hallucination. It didn’t flicker when I turned away. It didn’t shift into something else when I blinked.

I walked to the window and opened it.

Air rushed in — warm, sweet with dust and early sun. Somewhere outside, a bus groaned to a stop and a bird chirped once, sharp and cheerful.

I leaned on the frame. The sill pressed solidly into my arms.

It was all still here.

The light through the buildings. The sound of someone unlocking a bike chain. A breeze nudging the curtain like a friend who didn’t know how to say hello.

I let my eyes drift closed.

It didn’t feel like a dream.
It felt like a place I had come home to.

The phone rang.

It startled me. I nearly knocked the mug over reaching for it.

Larry lit up the screen.

I hesitated a second. Then answered.

“Hey,” he said, voice casual, already halfway into a thought. “You ghosted after class yesterday. Didn’t even text. Thought maybe you passed out on the floor again or something.”

A small, dumb laugh escaped me. “No, I’m good. Just needed to crash, I think.”

“Fair. You looked like you got hit by a bus emotionally. Or, like, spiritually.”

“Yeah. That’s… not wrong.”

“You wanna grab lunch after class today? Usual spot?”

“Yeah. Sounds good.”

“Cool. Later.”

He hung up before I could say goodbye. That was just his rhythm.

I stared at the screen a moment longer before setting it down. The room felt different now. Brighter, somehow. Like someone had turned up the saturation on everything by just a few percent.

Not enough to be obvious.
Just enough to feel alive.

I walked back to the window and leaned on it again.

For a while, I said nothing. Thought nothing.

I didn’t know why this was happening.
Didn’t know what rule I had broken or what law of physics I had slipped through.

Maybe I really was dreaming.
Maybe I’d finally snapped, and my mind was playing a long con.
Maybe I’d wake up again tomorrow with none of this left.

But for now… I was here.

And for now… that was enough.

If this was a lie —
a kindness my brain conjured to soften the fall —
then I would let it.

Because even if it wasn’t real…

It felt better than anything that ever was.

And for the first time, I didn’t ask how long it would last.

I just let myself enjoy it.
