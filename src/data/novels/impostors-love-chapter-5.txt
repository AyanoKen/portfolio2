I didn’t leave my bed for nearly an hour.

I just sat there, hunched forward, the real world pressing down around me like thick air.

Everything felt louder. The refrigerator. The fan. Even the stillness had a kind of static to it. It didn’t feel like home. Not anymore.

I kept expecting my phone to buzz with a message from Larry. Or a calendar alert from Central Hills. Something. Anything.

But it never came.

I was alone.

And this time, it wasn’t quiet.
It was empty.

Eventually, I stood. My legs felt weak, like I hadn’t used them in days. The air in the apartment was stale. My tongue was dry. My reflection in the bathroom mirror looked… dull. Washed out. Like someone had pulled the contrast slider all the way down on my life.

I splashed water on my face and stared at myself.

Same old cracked mirror. Same bags under my eyes. Same toothbrush with the fading bristles. Nothing out of place. Nothing new.

Except me.

I wandered around the apartment like a stranger. Touched the corner of the desk. Opened the fridge. Closed it. Sat on the couch. Turned on the TV. Turned it back off.

Nothing stuck. Nothing felt right.

I checked my phone. Real phone. Old lock screen. 142 unread emails. Half of them from people I hadn’t spoken to in months. Some update from the project manager about a feature launch. A group chat still muted from weeks ago.

I stared at it until the screen dimmed.

What was I supposed to do now?

Pretend like it didn’t happen?

Pretend I hadn’t lived a week in a world that made me feel — for the first time in years — like I could breathe again?

Pretend I hadn’t met her?

No.
I hadn’t met her.
I’d seen her. Once.

And yet—

And it wasn’t just her.

It was all of it.

The apartment with its lemon-scented quiet.
Larry’s dumb sarcasm and surprise granola bars.
The sound of pencil scratches in lecture halls.
The art posters hanging in the quad.
The fucking cactus on the windowsill.

How do you grieve something that might not have existed?

I sat back down on the bed and ran both hands through my hair.

This was insane.
People don’t miss their dreams.
Not like this.

I wasn’t supposed to remember so much. I wasn’t supposed to wake up feeling like someone had ripped me out of a life that belonged to me more than this one ever did.

And yet here I was — back in the place I fought so hard to build.

And all I wanted was to leave it again.


I tried to work.

That’s what I always did when things didn’t make sense.
Work. Type. Focus. Let the rhythm of input and output overwrite the parts of my brain that wanted to scream.

I opened my laptop.

It took a second to remember the password. That had never happened before.

The screen lit up with a dozen open tabs — ticket boards, test dashboards, an unfinished documentation file titled “Final QA Guidelines – Client Freeze Week.”

I stared at it like it was written in another language.


Some teammate pinged me about a regression from last sprint.
I replied with a thumbs-up emoji. I didn’t even read the message.

Another alert came in — 11:00 AM daily sync, starting in five.

I joined. Camera off. Mic muted.

The voices droned on.

Milestones. Delays. Dependencies.
I heard the words, but they passed through me like wind through a cracked window.

I looked down at my hands. They were on the keyboard, fingers hovering over the keys like they remembered how to type. But my mind was elsewhere. Not even just elsewhere — someone else.

I closed my eyes.

The sound of the video call faded into a memory that didn’t belong here:
the murmur of students across a campus.
The scratch of pencil on paper.
The clink of ceramic mugs in a campus café.

And her voice. Not even words — just the lilt of her laugh.

I opened my eyes again.

Still here.

Still this desk. This apartment. This dead-blue light. This job.

My stomach clenched. Not from hunger. From something else — something tighter, more hollow. Like grief. Like withdrawal.

I left the meeting early. Logged off everything. Shut the laptop.

I couldn’t do it.

I walked to the window. Stared out at the street.
A delivery truck reversed, beeping.
A man walked his dog, eyes glued to his phone.
The sun glared off the side of a car, sharp and clinical.

None of it felt like it mattered.

In the dream, even the smallest things had weight.
The way the sunlight slanted into the apartment.
The chipped mug on the counter.
The way the air smelled after it rained.
Even silence had depth.

Here, everything was flat. Empty. Functional.
Like a life built to be endured, not lived.

Around noon, I showered. Stared at the wall for too long. Didn’t bother shaving.

I made coffee and didn’t drink it.

I opened my email, then closed it again.

I didn’t know what I was looking for — maybe some mistake, some rupture in the real world. Something that said: Yes, it happened. Yes, it meant something. Yes, you’re not crazy.

But there was nothing.

Just me. And this place.
This perfectly functional, deeply lifeless place.

And even though I kept telling myself it was just a dream…
I didn’t believe it.

Because whatever it was, it felt more real than anything I was doing right now.

And I would’ve done anything — anything — to fall asleep and find myself back there.


By evening, the stillness had grown teeth.

There was no great breakdown. No panic attack. Just silence. The kind that sits on your chest and dares you to move.

I didn’t know how many times I’d checked the clock. Or stared at my phone screen, hoping for… what, exactly? A glitch in the date? A missed call from a name that didn’t exist?

None came.

I kept replaying the moment I woke up.
The rush of cold. The weightless dread.
The feeling of being yanked upward through layers of something warm and human into a place too sharp, too flat.

But dreams fade.
That’s what they do.

And this one had been clinging on longer than it should’ve.

I sat on the floor, back against the couch, knees drawn in. My laptop was still open on the table, Microsoft Teams pinging softly with unread messages I had no intention of responding to.

Team Sync - Rescheduled to Tomorrow 10AM.
 Ticket 2318 assigned to you.
 Please review the Q2 notes before end of day.

They may as well have been in another language.

I closed the laptop without looking.

I knew what I needed to do.

I had to come back.
Fully.
Mentally. Physically. Emotionally.

I had to remind myself that this was real.
Not the red-brick university.
Not the art posters or lazy afternoon light.
Not Larry.
Not that girl I never even spoke to.

It was just a dream.

A vivid, cruel dream.
One that gave me a week of borrowed joy before dropping me back into the same gray hallway I’d spent the last year trying not to stare down.

I stood up and made a list. Literally.

Titled it "Things I Know Are Real".

Rent is due Friday.
The kettle leaks slightly when overfilled.
There’s a crack in the mirror above the bathroom sink.
My mother texts every Sunday around noon, even when I forget to reply.
Teams meetings happen whether I show up or not.
I stared at the list for a long time.
Then added one more.

I am here. Now.
I read it again. Out loud. Like that would make it truer.

It helped. A little.
Like grabbing onto something solid during turbulence.

That night, I turned off the lights early. Not to sleep. Just to sit in the dark.

And when I finally climbed into bed — I didn’t expect to wake up anywhere else.

For the first time since that strange morning in the hospital, I let go of the possibility.

I stopped hoping for a slip in logic.
Stopped expecting to open my eyes and find yellow curtains, a cracked mug, and the hush of another life waiting.

It was over.

It was a dream.

I repeated that in my head like a mantra.

It was a dream. It was just a dream.

And eventually, I fell asleep.

Not with longing.
Not with hope.

Just tired acceptance.

—---------------------x—---------------------



Days passed.

Not all at once. Just enough to make them indistinguishable.

I worked. Answered emails. Nodded through Teams meetings with the mic muted and the camera off. Typed updates into ticket threads I barely read. Ate the same meals I always did. Took showers at the same hour. Walked from the desk to the bed and back like a wind-up toy with no wind left.

Nothing happened.

And maybe that was the point.

The first night back, I lay in bed wide-eyed, half-expecting the world to flicker and fall away again.
It didn’t.

The second night, I tried to will myself into it. Closed my eyes, slowed my breathing, visualized every detail I could remember — the university buildings, the smell of the apartment, the faint curve of her smile.

Still nothing.

The third night, I didn’t try.
The fourth, I barely remembered the dream at all.

By the fifth, I stopped checking.

Stopped hoping.
Stopped wondering if it had meant something.

Because I was still here.

The real world didn’t wait for grief. It didn’t care that I’d found something better. It simply filled in the silence with meetings and takeout receipts and leftover laundry I couldn’t remember wearing.

Eventually, I began to move like I used to — same bus stop, same dinner playlist, same everything. Not because I wanted to.

Because the mind is good at forgetting what it can’t have.


That night, I brushed my teeth, folded the blanket down, turned off the light, and got into bed.

No anticipation.
No second thoughts.

Just tired limbs and a blank mind.

I set the alarm. Plugged in my phone. Rolled over.

Sleep came quietly.

And this time, I didn’t expect anything else.
