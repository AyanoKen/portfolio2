I woke up in the same bed.

Same window. Same pale yellow curtains. Same beeping IV, same smell of disinfectant baked into the air like it lived here.

For a second — just a second — I waited for the cracks in the ceiling.

For the hum of my apartment fan.
For the lurch of the real world dragging me back.

But it didn’t come.

I was still here.

I pushed myself up on my elbows, slowly. My body still ached — not in that fading dream way, but the deep soreness of real bruises, real trauma. My throat was dry. My arm itched where the IV held it in place.

I looked around the room again, just to be sure.

Nothing had changed.

A nurse walked by the open door. I could hear distant murmuring at the station down the hall. The world outside my room was active, moving, ordinary in the most maddening way.

This wasn’t how dreams worked.
They faded. They jumped. They broke apart the second you tried to study them.

This one was holding its shape.

I reached for the call button and stopped halfway.

What would I even say?

“Hi, yeah, I think I’m stuck in someone else’s life and I’d like to leave now.”

I lay back down and stared at the ceiling instead.

Maybe this was just a coma. Maybe I hit my head harder than I thought, and my brain was doing one of those elaborate dying neuron things — stringing together a coherent fantasy as a final act before it all shut off.

But it didn’t feel like fantasy.

There were too many pieces. Too many people moving around me with lives that didn’t revolve around mine.

I wasn’t the center of anything here.

Rachel was still unconscious.
Larry was still real.
There was a photo on my hospital table of a life I hadn’t lived.
Detectives. Doctors. Beeping monitors.

I was either losing my mind in a coma of my own…

Or this was something else.

I didn’t say anything. Not out loud. But the thought crawled in anyway:

If this isn’t a dream… then where does that leave the other version of me?

The one who belonged here.
The one she loved.

The one who’s supposed to wake up in this bed.

Because it sure as hell wasn’t me.


It was the seventh morning.

A nurse wheeled in a discharge packet, a folded change of clothes, and a clipboard with my name on it.

A name that felt more like a costume every time I saw it printed.

The bed had already been stripped down. The IV removed. The room smelled faintly of bleach now — like it was already erasing my presence. Making room for someone new.

“You’re free to go whenever you’re ready,” the nurse said cheerfully, like I was leaving a hotel. “Doctor signed off this morning. Just don’t lift anything heavy, alright?”

I nodded, though my hands were clenched into the sheets.

She wheeled in a bag next — my things. The contents looked ordinary enough: jeans, a hoodie, an old phone charger tangled into a knot.

“Your friend Larry dropped these off a few days ago. Said you’d want your own clothes once you were up and walking.”

“Thanks.”

She left me alone to change. The room felt too big once she was gone.

I sat there for a moment, staring at the clothes.
They looked like something I’d wear. They fit. The hoodie even had a tiny stain near the cuff — something vaguely coffee-colored. A scar from another life’s morning.

Everything about this world obeyed the rules of reality. That was the part that made me uneasy.
There were no floating dream logic gaps. No sudden scene cuts. No metaphors trying to teach me a lesson.
Just fabric. Zippers. Dust on a windowsill.

I dressed slowly.

When I stood, my legs held.

The soreness was still there, but dulled now — familiar, manageable. Like a bruise after you’ve forgotten where it came from. The weight of the hospital gown was gone, but the weight in my chest hadn’t moved.

I stepped into the hallway, blinking under the brighter overhead lights. A nurse waved politely from the station. Someone rolled past in a wheelchair. An orderly pushed a cart of linen toward the laundry chute.

Normal. All of it.

Too normal.

I walked past Room 417. I didn’t stop. Didn’t look inside.

I didn’t need to. I already knew who was there.

Rachel.

The name carried its own temperature.
I hadn’t seen her yet — not since the crash — and still, her absence followed me like a shadow.

She loved someone who looked like me.

She might wake up and expect him to still be here.

I wasn’t ready for that.

I reached the elevator and pressed the button. The doors slid open with a soft mechanical sigh.

Outside, the world waited.

I didn’t know where home was.
But I knew someone had left it behind for me.

Larry was already waiting by the curb when I stepped outside. Leaned against the hood of a weather-worn hatchback, tapping through something on his phone. He looked up, pocketed it, and popped the passenger door open with a jerk of his chin.

“Ride’s here,” he said. “Try not to die again.”

I managed a breath that might’ve been a laugh and climbed in.

The car ride was quiet.

Larry didn’t talk much this time, which I appreciated. The radio was on, low, some indie track drifting between static. The kind of song you forget while it’s playing but remember when you’re trying to fall asleep.

I watched the city pass through the window. Trees and signs. Red lights blinking like slow heartbeats. Apartment buildings too close together. A woman on a bicycle carrying a brown paper bag.

It looked like a place I could’ve lived.

It didn’t feel like mine.

“Almost there,” Larry said as we turned onto a narrow side street. “They’re still doing construction near the corner, so parking might be a pain.”

I nodded, though I wasn’t really listening.

The street was lined with low buildings — three-story walk-ups with old bricks and laundry strung on balconies. A cat lounged on a windowsill like it paid rent.

Larry pulled into a cramped spot half a block down and cut the engine.

He didn’t get out right away.

“You good?” he asked.

I nodded again, slower this time. “Yeah.”

He reached into the glove box and pulled out a keyring.

“Spare set. Your landlord left them with me when you got admitted. Place should be clean. I watered the plant — if you can believe that.”

I offered a thin smile.

“Text if you need anything,” he said. “Anything at all.”

“Thanks.”

He didn’t say goodbye. Just nodded, once, and drove off.

I stood there for a second, holding the keys in my palm like they might vanish. The metal was warm from his hand. The tag read Unit 2B in smudged black marker.

The building was old. The kind that groans when you step inside. Faded green carpet in the hall. Fluorescent lights that flickered once before settling.

The door opened with a low creak. Not stuck. Just old.

It smelled like dust, detergent, and faintly of something citrus. Maybe a candle long burned out.

Inside was small. A studio. Narrow kitchen to the left, single window on the far wall, desk tucked under a shelf of old books. A sagging couch faced a TV too big for the room. Everything in here looked lived in, but not cluttered.

On the counter sat a small cactus in a cracked mug. A folded piece of mail. A cheap white lamp.

The bed was made.

I stood in the doorway for a while, just staring.

There were no pictures on the walls.
No family photos.
No notes taped to the fridge from a roommate or a parent or anyone else.

Just a stack of class syllabi on the table. A calendar with assignment deadlines. A single photograph, tucked into the edge of the mirror:

Me — or him — and Rachel.
Laughing.
Her hand on his shoulder, his head tilted toward her like they’d been doing that forever.

I looked around the room again. Nothing about it told me who he really was.

But it did tell me one thing.

He’d been alone here.

I set the keys on the counter and closed the door behind me. The click of the latch felt too final.

For a moment, I just stood there, taking in the silence.

There was no hum of a roommate’s music, no voices through thin walls. Just the soft ticking of a cheap analog clock and the distant sound of traffic beyond the window.

I moved slowly, like I was afraid to disturb something.

The apartment wasn’t messy, but it wasn’t staged either. It had that lived-in, halfway-kept look. A few mugs in the sink. A jacket slung over the back of a chair. A shoe rack by the door with only one shoe slightly out of line.

It was clean in the way people clean for themselves — not for guests.

I sat down at the desk beneath the shelf of books. The chair creaked beneath me. On the surface were a few spiral notebooks, a USB drive, a receipt for something I didn’t recognize, and a closed laptop with a sticker on the corner that said Property of Central Hills University.

I opened it. No password.

The wallpaper was a photo of a beach. Not tropical — rocky, gray-skied, peaceful. The kind of place someone would go to be alone, not to celebrate.

The desktop was cluttered, but not chaotic. Folders labeled Thesis, Fall2022, Applications, Rachel.

I didn’t open that last one.

Instead, I clicked into a folder called Classes. It was full of PDFs. Syllabi. Lecture notes. Homework submissions. Everything dated from the last year.

Midterm due dates. Project rubrics. An email exchange with a professor who had asked if he was okay missing class last week. The professor’s reply read:

Of course. Just focus on getting better. We’ll get you caught up when you’re ready to return.

It didn’t feel like a dream anymore. It felt like I’d stolen someone’s inbox.

I closed the laptop and looked around again. The shelf above the desk had textbooks, mostly computer science and statistics. One spine was cracked halfway through. Bookmarks stuck out of it like teeth.

I walked to the dresser. There were clothes — all my size, but none of them mine. A pack of gum. Receipts. Loose change. A folded flier for a film screening on campus next week.

And on the nightstand, under a small glass of water with dust settling around the rim, was a worn student ID.

The name matched mine.
The face too.
But the eyes were different.

I set it down and finally sat on the edge of the bed.

The apartment wasn’t haunted. There were no ghosts here. No twisted dream logic or surrealism waiting to shatter at the edges.

It was just a quiet, practical space.

Someone had lived here. Someone real. Someone solitary.

Someone I was supposed to become.

The sun outside had started to dip behind the buildings, casting long amber streaks across the room. I hadn’t turned on a single light. It didn’t feel like mine to touch.

Eventually, I picked up the phone from the nightstand.

It was already charged. The screen lit up with a faint vibration. No passcode.

The wallpaper was the same photo from the laptop — that quiet beach with its colorless sky.

Notifications poured in.

Missed messages. Group chats. A few unopened emails. A message from Larry asking if I made it home okay. One from someone named Erin:

“Heard you’re out. Let me know if you need anything. Welcome back, man.”

I scrolled. There were calendar alerts, class reminders, assignment due dates.

One stood out — an event labeled simply "Return to Campus – Monday".

A tiny pin on a map showed the location: Central Hills University. I'd never heard of it. But somehow it knew me.

I opened the gallery.

There were photos of Rachel. Some with me — the other me. A few group shots, some blurry cafe tables, the kind of photos that only make sense when you were there.
They didn’t mean anything to me, but the look in his eyes did.

He had been happy. Or maybe he had just looked happy for her.

I backed out of the app and tossed the phone onto the bed.

A while later, I left the apartment.

It was still warm out — the golden hour kind of warmth that hugged the pavement but didn’t suffocate. People were out. Not many, but enough. College students, mostly. Sitting on porches. Sharing drinks. Walking in pairs or small clusters like gravity pulled them together by default.

I walked without a destination. Down the block, through a side street, into a small park I didn’t know existed. There was a bench near the fountain, so I sat there for a while.
