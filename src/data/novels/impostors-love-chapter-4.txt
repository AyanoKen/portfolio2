I woke up in the same bed.

Same window. Same pale yellow curtains. Same beeping IV, same smell of disinfectant baked into the air like it lived here.

For a second ‚Äî just a second ‚Äî I waited for the cracks in the ceiling.

For the hum of my apartment fan.
For the lurch of the real world dragging me back.

But it didn‚Äôt come.

I was still here.

I pushed myself up on my elbows, slowly. My body still ached ‚Äî not in that fading dream way, but the deep soreness of real bruises, real trauma. My throat was dry. My arm itched where the IV held it in place.

I looked around the room again, just to be sure.

Nothing had changed.

A nurse walked by the open door. I could hear distant murmuring at the station down the hall. The world outside my room was active, moving, ordinary in the most maddening way.

This wasn‚Äôt how dreams worked.
They faded. They jumped. They broke apart the second you tried to study them.

This one was holding its shape.

I reached for the call button and stopped halfway.

What would I even say?

‚ÄúHi, yeah, I think I‚Äôm stuck in someone else‚Äôs life and I‚Äôd like to leave now.‚Äù

I lay back down and stared at the ceiling instead.

Maybe this was just a coma. Maybe I hit my head harder than I thought, and my brain was doing one of those elaborate dying neuron things ‚Äî stringing together a coherent fantasy as a final act before it all shut off.

But it didn‚Äôt feel like fantasy.

There were too many pieces. Too many people moving around me with lives that didn‚Äôt revolve around mine.

I wasn‚Äôt the center of anything here.

Rachel was still unconscious.
Larry was still real.
There was a photo on my hospital table of a life I hadn‚Äôt lived.
Detectives. Doctors. Beeping monitors.

I was either losing my mind in a coma of my own‚Ä¶

Or this was something else.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. Not out loud. But the thought crawled in anyway:

If this isn‚Äôt a dream‚Ä¶ then where does that leave the other version of me?

The one who belonged here.
The one she loved.

The one who‚Äôs supposed to wake up in this bed.

Because it sure as hell wasn‚Äôt me.


It was the seventh morning.

A nurse wheeled in a discharge packet, a folded change of clothes, and a clipboard with my name on it.

A name that felt more like a costume every time I saw it printed.

The bed had already been stripped down. The IV removed. The room smelled faintly of bleach now ‚Äî like it was already erasing my presence. Making room for someone new.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre free to go whenever you‚Äôre ready,‚Äù the nurse said cheerfully, like I was leaving a hotel. ‚ÄúDoctor signed off this morning. Just don‚Äôt lift anything heavy, alright?‚Äù

I nodded, though my hands were clenched into the sheets.

She wheeled in a bag next ‚Äî my things. The contents looked ordinary enough: jeans, a hoodie, an old phone charger tangled into a knot.

‚ÄúYour friend Larry dropped these off a few days ago. Said you‚Äôd want your own clothes once you were up and walking.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

She left me alone to change. The room felt too big once she was gone.

I sat there for a moment, staring at the clothes.
They looked like something I‚Äôd wear. They fit. The hoodie even had a tiny stain near the cuff ‚Äî something vaguely coffee-colored. A scar from another life‚Äôs morning.

Everything about this world obeyed the rules of reality. That was the part that made me uneasy.
There were no floating dream logic gaps. No sudden scene cuts. No metaphors trying to teach me a lesson.
Just fabric. Zippers. Dust on a windowsill.

I dressed slowly.

When I stood, my legs held.

The soreness was still there, but dulled now ‚Äî familiar, manageable. Like a bruise after you‚Äôve forgotten where it came from. The weight of the hospital gown was gone, but the weight in my chest hadn‚Äôt moved.

I stepped into the hallway, blinking under the brighter overhead lights. A nurse waved politely from the station. Someone rolled past in a wheelchair. An orderly pushed a cart of linen toward the laundry chute.

Normal. All of it.

Too normal.

I walked past Room 417. I didn‚Äôt stop. Didn‚Äôt look inside.

I didn‚Äôt need to. I already knew who was there.

Rachel.

The name carried its own temperature.
I hadn‚Äôt seen her yet ‚Äî not since the crash ‚Äî and still, her absence followed me like a shadow.

She loved someone who looked like me.

She might wake up and expect him to still be here.

I wasn‚Äôt ready for that.

I reached the elevator and pressed the button. The doors slid open with a soft mechanical sigh.

Outside, the world waited.

I didn‚Äôt know where home was.
But I knew someone had left it behind for me.


I reached the elevator and pressed the button. The doors slid open with a soft mechanical sigh.

But I knew someone had left it behind for me.

Larry was already waiting by the curb when I stepped outside. Leaned against the hood of a weather-worn hatchback, tapping through something on his phone. He looked up, pocketed it, and popped the passenger door open with a jerk of his chin.

‚ÄúRide‚Äôs here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTry not to die again.‚Äù

I managed a breath that might‚Äôve been a laugh and climbed in.

The car ride was quiet.

Larry didn‚Äôt talk much this time, which I appreciated. The radio was on, low, some indie track drifting between static. The kind of song you forget while it‚Äôs playing but remember when you‚Äôre trying to fall asleep.

I watched the city pass through the window. Trees and signs. Red lights blinking like slow heartbeats. Apartment buildings too close together. A woman on a bicycle carrying a brown paper bag.

It looked like a place I could‚Äôve lived.

It didn‚Äôt feel like mine.

‚ÄúAlmost there,‚Äù Larry said as we turned onto a narrow side street. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still doing construction near the corner, so parking might be a pain.‚Äù

I nodded, though I wasn‚Äôt really listening.

The street was lined with low buildings ‚Äî three-story walk-ups with old bricks and laundry strung on balconies. A cat lounged on a windowsill like it paid rent.

Larry pulled into a cramped spot half a block down and cut the engine.

He didn‚Äôt get out right away.

‚ÄúYou good?‚Äù he asked.

I nodded again, slower this time. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

He reached into the glove box and pulled out a keyring.

‚ÄúSpare set. Your landlord left them with me when you got admitted. Place should be clean. I watered the plant ‚Äî if you can believe that.‚Äù

I offered a thin smile.

‚ÄúText if you need anything,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnything at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt say goodbye. Just nodded, once, and drove off.

I stood there for a second, holding the keys in my palm like they might vanish. The metal was warm from his hand. The tag read Unit 2B in smudged black marker.

The building was old. The kind that groans when you step inside. Faded green carpet in the hall. Fluorescent lights that flickered once before settling.

The door opened with a low creak. Not stuck. Just old.

It smelled like dust, detergent, and faintly of something citrus. Maybe a candle long burned out.

Inside was small. A studio. Narrow kitchen to the left, single window on the far wall, desk tucked under a shelf of old books. A sagging couch faced a TV too big for the room. Everything in here looked lived in, but not cluttered.

On the counter sat a small cactus in a cracked mug. A folded piece of mail. A cheap white lamp.

The bed was made.

I stood in the doorway for a while, just staring.

There were no pictures on the walls.
No family photos.
No notes taped to the fridge from a roommate or a parent or anyone else.

Just a stack of class syllabi on the table. A calendar with assignment deadlines. A single photograph, tucked into the edge of the mirror:

Me ‚Äî or him ‚Äî and Rachel.
Laughing.
Her hand on his shoulder, his head tilted toward her like they‚Äôd been doing that forever.

I looked around the room again. Nothing about it told me who he really was.

But it did tell me one thing.

He‚Äôd been alone here.

I set the keys on the counter and closed the door behind me. The click of the latch felt too final.

For a moment, I just stood there, taking in the silence.

There was no hum of a roommate‚Äôs music, no voices through thin walls. Just the soft ticking of a cheap analog clock and the distant sound of traffic beyond the window.

I moved slowly, like I was afraid to disturb something.

The apartment wasn‚Äôt messy, but it wasn‚Äôt staged either. It had that lived-in, halfway-kept look. A few mugs in the sink. A jacket slung over the back of a chair. A shoe rack by the door with only one shoe slightly out of line.

It was clean in the way people clean for themselves ‚Äî not for guests.

I sat down at the desk beneath the shelf of books. The chair creaked beneath me. On the surface were a few spiral notebooks, a USB drive, a receipt for something I didn‚Äôt recognize, and a closed laptop with a sticker on the corner that said Property of Central Hills University.

I opened it. No password.

The wallpaper was a photo of a beach. Not tropical ‚Äî rocky, gray-skied, peaceful. The kind of place someone would go to be alone, not to celebrate.

The desktop was cluttered, but not chaotic. Folders labeled Thesis, Fall2022, Applications, Rachel.

I didn‚Äôt open that last one.

Instead, I clicked into a folder called Classes. It was full of PDFs. Syllabi. Lecture notes. Homework submissions. Everything dated from the last year.

Midterm due dates. Project rubrics. An email exchange with a professor who had asked if he was okay missing class last week. The professor‚Äôs reply read:

Of course. Just focus on getting better. We‚Äôll get you caught up when you‚Äôre ready to return.

It didn‚Äôt feel like a dream anymore. It felt like I‚Äôd stolen someone‚Äôs inbox.

I closed the laptop and looked around again. The shelf above the desk had textbooks, mostly computer science and statistics. One spine was cracked halfway through. Bookmarks stuck out of it like teeth.

I walked to the dresser. There were clothes ‚Äî all my size, but none of them mine. A pack of gum. Receipts. Loose change. A folded flier for a film screening on campus next week.

And on the nightstand, under a small glass of water with dust settling around the rim, was a worn student ID.

The name matched mine.
The face too.
But the eyes were different.

I set it down and finally sat on the edge of the bed.

The apartment wasn‚Äôt haunted. There were no ghosts here. No twisted dream logic or surrealism waiting to shatter at the edges.

It was just a quiet, practical space.

Someone had lived here. Someone real. Someone solitary.

Someone I was supposed to become.

The weekend passed in quiet rhythms.

Each morning, I woke up expecting to be back in my real bed ó back in my box apartment, under that flickering ceiling fan. But it never happened.

The dream didnít end.

Each morning began with the same soft light through the apartment window. Same mild chill in the floorboards. Same faint scent of lemon and dust.

On Sunday, I opened the laptop again and actually read one of the assignments. It was some light programming theory ó something I remembered from a life I actually lived. I made it through five pages before realizing I wasnít pretending to be interested.

I answered Larryís text. Told him I was doing alright. He sent back a thumbs-up gif with a dumb cartoon raccoon in it.

That night, I fell asleep without questioning whether I'd wake up somewhere else. Not because I was sure ó but because, for the first time, I didnít want to.


ó-------------------------xó----------------------------



Monday came.

And with it, the return to campus.

Larry swung by in the morning. He was late, but unapologetic.

ìYouíre the one that died, not me,î he said, handing me a granola bar on the way out the door. ìDead guys donít get to complain.î

The university wasnít far ó a hilltop campus that stretched wider than it looked on the map. It felt alive in the way certain places do: not because of the buildings, but because of the people moving through them like they belonged.

Old brick facades. Iron railings. Trees that had been there longer than most students. Laughter somewhere behind me. A dog barking near the quad. The kind of chaotic quiet that makes you feel like you're part of something, even if youíre not.

Larry split off near the library. ìYou good?î

I nodded. ìYeah. Iíll text you if I get kidnapped by philosophy majors.î

ìDonít. Iíll let ëem keep you.î

Then he was gone, and I was left in the tide of people ó students moving like currents, flowing around one another effortlessly. I let it pull me.

I wasnít looking for anything. Just taking it in.

I turned the corner near the main quad.

And then ó I saw her.

She was standing at the base of the art building steps, holding a cup of something warm in both hands, blowing on it softly. Her hair caught the morning sun, not in that cinematic way where everything glows ó but in a way that made the color stay in my mind longer than it shouldíve.

She was laughing at something the girl beside her said. Not the self-conscious kind ó not a laugh performed, but something full and real, the kind that made her shoulders move and her eyes squint just a little.

She looked... alive. Completely unburdened by the weight I carried, or the silence Iíd gotten used to.

And in that moment, the noise of the campus thinned. Not gone ó just blurred. Like Iíd stepped behind glass and was seeing the world in its original draft.

I didnít know her name. Didnít know her story.
But something inside me reacted like I did.

Something old.
Or maybe something Iíd buried.

It wasnít attraction. It wasnít awe.
It was recognition ó of someone I hadnít met yet, but felt like Iíd forgotten.

She turned slightly. Our eyes didnít meet. She never noticed me.

But I noticed her.
And I knew ó in that moment ó something had shifted.

The dream had stopped feeling like a puzzle I was supposed to solve.
Now it felt like a place I didnít want to leave.


The rest of the day passed in quiet, ordinary motion.

I attended two classes ó or at least sat through them. One was held in a windowless lab room that smelled like whiteboard markers and overheated plastic. The other was a lecture in some old hall with creaky seats and a professor who didnít seem to believe in microphones.

People greeted me in passing. Some nodded, some smiled, a few said, ìHey, youíre back.î I smiled back. Said thanks. Pretended I remembered who they were.

I didnít see her again.
Not once.
But she stayed with me all day anyway.

Not in some romantic, whimsical way. Just quietly ó like the afterimage left behind when you look into the sun too long. She lingered at the edges of my thoughts. Every time I blinked, I expected to see her walking through a door or sitting beneath a tree. Every time someone laughed, I checked without meaning to.

I didnít know her name.
But that hadnít stopped my mind from giving her one anyway ó a placeholder, a shape to wrap the feeling around.

By the time I got home, the sky had dimmed into that deep blue hour where the buildings outside lose their edges. The air was cool. The apartment felt less foreign than it had when I first walked in. I made pasta I didnít finish. Turned on a show I didnít watch. Answered a text from Larry with a ìNot bad. Getting there.î That was it.

Just another normal day.

Except it wasnít.
Not to me.


Later, I lay in bed with the lights off. The shadows moved on the ceiling like waves behind glass.

I was tired, but not in a way that sleep could fix.

I turned over, pulled the blanket tighter, and stared at the closed blinds.
Nothing moved. No flickering. No dream logic unraveling.
The world was holding its shape.

And thatís what scared me.

It had been nearly a week since I woke up in that hospital bed. Nearly a week of pretending to be someone else ó but the pretending had started to feel less like acting and more likeÖ settling.

Everything here was too coherent. Too continuous. I remembered faces from class. I remembered street names. My phone buzzed with reminders I didnít set. My email inbox was full of things I was expected to care about.

And strangest of allÖ part of me wanted to.

I wanted to show up to class on time. I wanted to respond to Larry with something more than surface-level replies. I wanted to know what the assignment was. I wanted to see her again.

That girl. The one near the art building.

Her laugh had cut through the noise like it was tuned to a different frequency.
Not perfect. Not angelic. Just real.
Unbothered. Present.
Everything I didnít know how to be anymore.

There was no logical reason I shouldíve remembered her. No reason I shouldíve wanted to. I hadnít spoken to her. I didnít even get a good look at her face.

But something in me ó some quiet, aching part ó was already building a space around her.

Maybe it was the way she carried herself.
Maybe it was just the kind of story I needed.

I thought about that as my eyes began to close.
About the curve of the sidewalk she walked on.
About the way this world, this strange stitched-together replica of a life, had started to feel more breathable than my own.

Maybe I was going crazy.
Maybe I didnít care.

Because for the first time in a long while, I didnít feel like I was being chased by my own mind.
For the first time, I wasnít clinging to anything.

I let go.
I let the dream have me.

And just as the weight started to slip awayó

I woke up gasping.

Cold air hit my lungs like a slap. The warmth was gone. So was the light. So was everything.

My hands shot forward, reaching for sheets that werenít there. The fabric felt rough. Wrong.

Where wasó

I looked around.

No yellow curtains. No sunlight. No gentle hum of the city outside. Justó

The ceiling fan, spinning lazily overhead.

The cracked plaster.

The faint electric buzz of the fridge down the hall.

No.
No, no, no, noó

I sat up too fast. My head spun. I grabbed the edge of the bed, heart pounding.

This wasnít right.
This wasnít where I was supposed to be.
Iíd justó
I was just there.

The campus.
The apartment.
Larry.
Her.

I pressed my hands to my face. My skin was cold.

I tried to breathe slowly, but it felt like I was choking on air that didnít belong to me anymore.

It had felt so real.

I remembered walking across campus. The taste of shitty black coffee. The sound of her laugh. The way her hair moved in the light. I remembered it like a memory, not a dream.

So why was I back here?

Was it ever real?

Was any of it real?

I looked around the room like I might find a piece of it hidden somewhere. A leftover detail. A trace. But there was nothing. Just the same lifeless gray Iíd woken to every morning before this all began.

I swung my legs over the edge of the bed and sat there, elbows on my knees, hands clenched.

What the hell was that?

I wanted to believe it was just a dream.
I wanted to believe Iíd imagined all of it.
But I didnít feel relief.

I felt loss.

Deep, stupid, impossible loss ó for a world I mightíve made upÖ and a girl I never got to know.
