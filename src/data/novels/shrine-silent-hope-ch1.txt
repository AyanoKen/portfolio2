Prologue

The bus jolted violently as it hit another bump in the road, sending a shudder through its metal frame. Kaito barely stirred, his head resting against the rattling window, a pair of earbuds dangling loosely from one ear. The faint hum of static leaked from them, long since disconnected from any signal. He breathed slow and steady, the perfect image of someone with not a single care in the world.

In contrast, Aki sat perfectly upright across from him, her hands folded neatly in her lap, back straight, gaze fixed ahead. She had barely blinked for the last twenty minutes. If anyone noticed, no one said a word.

"Third bump in five minutes," Ren muttered from behind them, tapping something into his phone.

"The road's old," Aki said quietly. Her voice was steady, but something about it made Ren glance up from his screen. "They don't fix it anymore."

He gave a noncommittal grunt, tucking his phone back into his jacket. No signal anyway. There hadn't been for the last hour. He hadn't planned on coming here--none of them had--but the university said it was an honor to be selected for the exchange program. A unique opportunity. Two weeks in a quiet village, staying in a traditional dorm house, working on their group project. Exams, too, supposedly. Ren had barely listened during orientation.


Another jolt. The bus groaned around them. The driver didn't seem bothered.

Kaito stirred finally, one eye blinking open, just in time to catch the first glimpse of the village as the bus rounded a corner.

It came into view slowly. Wooden houses pressed close together. Roofs tiled in deep browns and blacks. Smoke rising thin and white from chimneys, though no one could see who tended the fires. The road narrowed sharply as they descended toward it, the trees closing in behind them, as though cutting off their path of return.

"This is it?" Ren said, frowning. "Doesn't look like they even have power lines."

Aki's hands tightened in her lap. "They do," she said softly. "You just can't see them."

Kaito stretched, standing lazily as the bus hissed to a stop. "Well," he said, slinging his duffel bag over one shoulder, "no turning back now."

The bus doors clattered open. Cold air swept in. It carried a strange smell--not unpleasant, but old. Earthy. The kind of scent you might find clinging to a room that had been shut away for years.

Aki was the first to step off. Her shoes crunched on gravel, slow and deliberate. She didn't look back at them. Ren followed, muttering under his breath, tugging his scarf tighter around his neck.

Kaito stepped down last. He stood at the base of the steps for a long moment, staring at the village sprawled out in front of them.

And the people waiting at the edge of the road.

They didn't speak. Didn't smile. They stood in a line, unmoving, watching. Their clothes were simple, plain--robes, or maybe uniforms--but their eyes gleamed too brightly in the overcast light.

"Welcome home," Aki whispered under her breath. It was hard to tell who she was speaking to.



The village head was already waiting when they stepped off the bus.

He stood alone at the end of the narrow dirt path, hands folded neatly in front of him. He smiled as they approached, though the expression didn't quite reach his eyes. They were dark, almost black, and they didn't blink nearly enough.

"Welcome," he said, his voice smooth but low, like it was dampened by heavy cloth. "We are honored to have young minds visit us. It has been... some time since we've had guests of your nature."

The group of ten students gathered loosely around him. Ren stood just behind Kaito's shoulder, eyes flicking between the man and the village beyond.

Senior Student, Nakajima-senpai, stepped forward with the practiced ease of someone taking control. "Thank you for having us, Village Head-sama," he said, bowing respectfully. "We'll do our best not to impose."

The village head tilted his head at an angle too sharp to be comfortable. "No imposition. You belong here now."

There was a silence. Not quite awkward, but not quite right either.

Kaito's gaze wandered, drifting over the rows of villagers standing further back. None of them moved. Some didn't even seem to breathe.

Aki's hand brushed his as she stepped closer to him. He glanced at her, but she didn't meet his eyes.

"You've all had a long journey," the village head continued. "Let me show you to your lodging."



The house they were led to sat on the edge of the village, where the dirt road gave way to flattened grass and old stone. It was large--far too big for a single family--but time had clearly taken its toll. The wood was worn smooth in some places and splintered in others. The air smelled faintly of dust and old incense.

Inside, the space was... cramped.

"It's like one big room," Ren muttered, dragging his bag behind him as they stepped inside.

The room stretched long and narrow, ceiling beams exposed, paper windows stained yellow with age. Thin, heavy curtains divided the space into smaller sections, each barely large enough for a futon and a bag. Some curtains didn't reach all the way to the floor.

"No doors," Kaito noted quietly. He nudged one of the curtains with his knuckles. The fabric was thick, almost too heavy for its own good. It barely shifted at his touch.

Aki walked past him, setting her things down in a corner section. "They didn't have much time to set up for us," she said, not quite looking at anyone. "We were a late addition this year."

Ren whistled low. "Didn't think we'd be camping indoors." He threw his bag down near Kaito's chosen space. "At least no bugs."

"Let's not test that," Kaito murmured.

Nakajima-senpai cleared his throat. "It's temporary. We'll be here two weeks. Make it work."



Later, after they had settled in as best they could, Nakajima called them all to the common area at the front of the house. The other students--most of them third-years and second-years--gathered in a loose circle, the flickering light of a single hanging bulb casting long shadows on the walls.

Nakajima stood at the front, posture stiff. "Listen up. We're here to complete a joint project with the village council. It's supposed to be a cultural exchange, so we'll be documenting folklore, mapping local areas, and doing interviews."

Ren raised his hand lazily. "What about the exams?"

"Minimal. Mostly theory," Nakajima replied. "But they want us to immerse ourselves in village life as much as possible. That's priority."

Aki was quiet, but her hands clenched tighter around the notebook she'd brought. Kaito noticed, but said nothing.

Nakajima continued. "They've scheduled activities for us. Some of us will visit farms, others will shadow craftsmen. We'll rotate."

"What about the shrine?" one student asked. "I thought we were supposed to--"

"You'll be told when," Nakajima said, cutting them off with an edge to his voice. "For now, we follow the council's schedule."

Kaito leaned back against one of the old beams, arms crossed. "We're tourists, basically."

"For now," Aki said softly, not looking at him.

The group dispersed soon after. Some lingered, trying to get signal on their phones. Others tested the communal kitchen's old gas stove.

By the time the sun dipped below the hills, the house was quiet. Most of the students retreated to their curtained spaces, settling in for the night.

Kaito lay back on his futon, arms behind his head, staring at the wooden slats of the ceiling.

"Man," Ren said from the other side of the curtain, "this is cozy in a dystopian prison kind of way."

"Better than outside," Kaito replied.

There was a pause. Then Ren laughed softly. "Yeah... sure."

After everyone's gone to sleep in their little curtained spaces, Kaito can't shake how different Aki seems. She's not the same elegant, cheerful girl he knows from campus. She's been quiet, tense... different.

After everyone's gone to sleep in their little curtained spaces, Kaito can't shake how different Aki seems. She's not the same elegant, cheerful girl he knows from campus. She's been quiet, tense... different.

-------------------------------x-------------------------------




















Kaito stood just outside the old dorm house, the night air cool against his skin. The trees rustled gently in the distance. For once, there wasn't a single sound from Ren. The guy had knocked out as soon as his head hit the futon.

He found Aki sitting alone on the back step, her legs tucked up against her chest. Moonlight caught the loose strands of her hair, and for a moment, she almost looked like she belonged here. Still. Quiet.

Too quiet.

"You never stop moving," Kaito said as he approached. "It's weird seeing you sit still."

Aki smiled faintly but didn't turn. "Tired, I guess."

Kaito sat down beside her, elbows resting on his knees. For a while, neither of them said anything. The silence was comfortable. Or it would've been, if Aki hadn't kept glancing at the tree line every couple of seconds.

"You're acting different," he said, finally breaking it. "Since we got here."

She let out a soft breath. "You noticed."

"I notice a lot of things," he replied. "I just don't usually say them out loud."

That made her laugh quietly, a sound closer to the Aki he knew.

But then she sobered again. "I'm from here" she began softly. "I used to be here when I was very little, until I was 10 if I remember correctly. One day, my parents left this place with me in a panic, without any notice or telling anyone."

Kaito didn't interrupt. He just waited.

"They... never told me why," Aki continued. "But they were always so careful. Our house was covered in charms--on the doorways, the windows. They even made me wear one around my neck." She gave a weak chuckle. "Said it was a good luck charm. I didn't believe them."

Her fingers drifted up to the thin silver chain around her neck, mostly hidden under her collar.

"But they used to tell me stories," she said. "About something bad here. An... evil entity. They never said what it was. Just that it was old, and it didn't forget."

Kaito tilted his head slightly. "And you think it's still here?"

Aki shrugged. "I don't know. But they were scared. I've never seen my father scared of anything, but when he talked about this place..." She trailed off, her fingers tightening on the charm. "I guess I brought their fear with me."

Kaito watched her quietly for a moment. Then he exhaled and leaned back on his hands. "I think you're overthinking it."

She looked at him.

"There's nothing wrong here," he said simply. "It's just an old village. Maybe too quiet. But if push comes to shove," he paused, turning his gaze toward her, "I'll protect you."

Aki blinked. Then smiled, genuinely this time. "You're all talk."

"I'm lazy," he admitted, a faint smirk tugging at his lips. "But I don't break promises."

For a few moments, they just sat there, listening to the night sounds. Aki seemed to breathe easier now.

"Thanks, Kaito," she said. Then nudged his shoulder gently. "Don't make me regret trusting you."

He gave a noncommittal hum, but he didn't move away.

When they stood to head back inside, Aki's steps were lighter. The girl he knew was back.

-------------------------------x-------------------------------





















The morning sun spilled through the paper windows, casting pale golden light across the worn wooden floors. Birds chattered softly in the distance. The sound of footsteps--bare feet padding across the floor--rustled behind the curtains as students stirred from their futons, stretching groggily in their cramped spaces.

Kaito was already awake. He lay on his back, staring at the ceiling beams above him, hands behind his head, one leg crossed over the other. He listened to the muffled voices of his classmates as they shook off sleep, some already complaining about the cold or how hard the futons were.

Ren's voice cut through the chatter.
"I'm calling it now. I'm the first one to break a bone tripping over someone's shoes."

"You sleep next to Kaito," someone mumbled in response.
"Exactly," Ren shot back. "This guy's got long legs. It's like bunking next to a deer."

Kaito sighed but made no effort to move. A minute later, Ren's head popped through the gap in his curtain.
"You alive, or...?"
Kaito finally sat up, ruffling his already messy hair. "Barely. Two days in and I am already regretting not packing instant noodles"

Ren grinned and ducked back out. "Good enough. Move it. They're serving breakfast soon, and I'm not waiting for your instant noodle dream to end."

Kaito smirked faintly and stood, rolling his shoulders as he did. He pulled aside his curtain and stepped into the narrow hallway that ran along the curtained "rooms." Some of the other students nodded in greeting; a few still looked half-asleep.

Across the room, Aki was tying her hair back, the loose strands catching the morning light. She noticed him watching and smiled--bright, warm, effortless.
"Morning," she said cheerfully.
"Morning," he replied, keeping it simple as always.

He wasn't sure if anyone else noticed how different she was from the first night. The tension was gone from her shoulders. She laughed when Ren said something dumb, nudged him playfully when he complained about the cold, and even teased Kaito for his slow pace as they headed out for breakfast.

It was like nothing had happened.



The village didn't have a school or café, but they had a community hall where meals were sometimes shared. The students walked together down the narrow dirt path, past rows of old wooden houses, the air crisp and fresh with the scent of damp earth.

A few villagers greeted them as they passed--small nods, polite bows. It was a far cry from the unsettling stares they'd received when they arrived. Maybe the village wasn't so strange after all.

Inside the hall, a long, low table had been set up with simple food: rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables, grilled fish. Everything was homemade and smelled surprisingly good.

Ren sat down immediately, rubbing his hands together.
"If this is what we get for breakfast, maybe I'll survive this trip after all."

Aki knelt neatly at his side, already thanking the elder who had set out the food. Kaito followed, settling across from them without much fanfare.

Nakajima-senpai made sure everyone was accounted for before sitting himself.
"Eat up," he said, tone practical but not unkind. "It's a long day."

They ate quietly at first, the only sounds the clink of chopsticks and murmured thanks. But soon, conversations picked up. Ren cracked jokes about who was going to fall asleep first during the cultural lecture later. One of the other girls, Mei, teased him about getting stuck with farming duty. Even Nakajima-senpai cracked a rare smile.

Kaito watched Aki out of the corner of his eye as she chatted with Mei. She was graceful, polite, funny. Just like back at the academy.

But every now and then, her gaze drifted out the window. Just for a second.



After breakfast, they were split into groups. Kaito, Aki, and Ren were assigned to work at one of the village's small farms, shadowing an old couple named Mr. and Mrs. Hayashi. Their house was nestled near the forest edge, surrounded by vegetable plots and a small rice field.

"You ever farm before?" Ren asked, nudging Kaito as they walked.

Kaito shrugged. "I've touched grass."

"That's not encouraging," Aki said with a laugh.

Mrs. Hayashi greeted them warmly, a wrinkled but spry woman who handed each of them a pair of gloves and wide straw hats. Mr. Hayashi, mostly silent, showed them how to weed the rows and check the plants. It was repetitive work but easy to pick up.

Ren struggled with the tasks at first, pulling up vegetables instead of weeds and complaining loudly every time his hands got muddy.
"City boy," Aki teased.
"Slander," Ren retorted. "I'm adaptable."

Kaito worked steadily, not fast but efficient. He didn't say much, but Mrs. Hayashi gave him an approving nod.

The hours passed quietly. The sun rose higher, warming the earth. They took breaks under the shade of a gnarled old tree, sharing bottles of barley tea. Aki stretched her arms over her head, smiling at the breeze. Ren lay flat on his back in the grass, declaring he was dying. Kaito sat cross-legged, watching the clouds move.

"Peaceful, isn't it?" Aki said.

Kaito nodded.
"Yeah," he said. "Doesn't feel like anything's wrong."

She glanced at him briefly.
"No," she agreed. "Not at all."

By the time they returned to the dorm house, the sky was painted in soft pink and orange hues. The students filed in, tired but content. Some immediately hit the communal bath. Others gathered around the low table to play cards or chat.

Ren managed to swipe extra snacks from the kitchen, tossing a rice cracker at Kaito's head.
"Snack time," he declared.
Kaito caught it without looking, taking a lazy bite.
"Thanks," he said.

Aki sat beside them, leaning back on her hands, watching the others laugh and joke. Her eyes crinkled as she smiled, laughing at one of Ren's bad impressions of Nakajima-senpai.

Later, they rolled out their futons, the curtains drawn loosely between them. The house creaked softly as it settled for the night.

Kaito lay on his back again, staring at the ceiling. He heard Ren's soft snoring on the other side. Aki's quiet breathing a little further off.

Everything was calm.

-------------------------------x-------------------------------




















The sunlight broke lazily through the thin clouds that morning, casting a pale shimmer over the village rooftops. The air smelled of damp earth, rice straw, and faint wood smoke. Another day in a place that had begun to feel less foreign, less strange. Almost familiar.

Kaito shuffled out of his curtained space, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. His hair was messier than usual, something he made no effort to fix. The thin floorboards were cold under his feet, but he ignored them. He could hear the others moving around, voices soft, laughter carrying lightly through the space.

Ren was already up, of course. Kaito caught him standing by the entrance, stuffing something into his jacket pocket. Snacks, probably.

"You're up early," Kaito said, his voice still rough from sleep.

Ren glanced at him over his shoulder, grinning. "Plotting."

Kaito raised an eyebrow. "Plotting?"

"Yeah. Your downfall."

Kaito didn't flinch. "You'll need a better plan than that."

Ren chuckled, pushing open the sliding door and stepping out onto the wooden porch. "Come on. Breakfast first. Scheming later."



They gathered in front of Nakajima-senpai after eating, standing in the weak sunlight as he explained the day's plans. The village had arranged various tasks again--some students would help repair tools in the workshop, others would assist in the rice fields. Nakajima assigned them with brisk efficiency.

"Kaito," he said, looking up from his notebook. "You're at the shrine today. You'll help with the offering preparation."

Kaito gave a small nod. Simple enough.

"Aki's on the same team," Nakajima added.

There was a flicker of something in his voice. Not disapproval. Maybe amusement? Hard to say.

Kaito didn't think much of it. Not until Ren elbowed him in the side, nearly making him drop the wooden tray he was carrying.

"Oi," Ren said, lowering his voice as they made their way out of the community hall. "You realize this is, like, your golden opportunity, right?"

Kaito sighed. "For what?"

Ren gave him a flat look. "You really are dense."

Kaito shrugged. "You say that like it's new information."

Ren groaned dramatically, throwing his head back as they walked. "For someone who's got a brain, you're hopeless."

They passed through one of the narrow side streets, their steps slow, unhurried. Kaito glanced at Ren sidelong. His friend wasn't smiling now, not really. He looked... serious.

"You should say something," Ren said. "To Aki."

Kaito said nothing for a moment. He kept his hands in his pockets, kicking at a stray stone on the road.

"She likes you," Ren added, unnecessarily. "Everyone knows it. She doesn't hide it. But she's not gonna wait forever, dude."

Kaito gave a slow exhale, watching the mist of his breath fade in the morning air. "I know."

He did know. He'd always known. He just didn't know what to do with that knowledge. Until now.



The path to the shrine was steep, stone steps winding up through a shaded grove of trees. The air grew cooler the higher they climbed, birds quieting as they neared the top. Kaito walked alongside Aki, the basket of offerings balanced neatly in her arms.

She was humming to herself--some old song, maybe something traditional--and there was a peacefulness in her expression that made him pause for a moment, walking a half-step behind just to watch her.

When she glanced back at him, she smiled. "You're quiet today."

"I'm always quiet," he replied, shifting the bamboo rake over his shoulder.

She tilted her head. "Quieter than usual."

He didn't have an answer for that. Instead, he nodded toward the shrine gate ahead. "We're here."

The shrine was small, old but well cared for. Moss crept along the stone lanterns lining the path, and the wood of the torii gate was darkened with age. It didn't feel eerie. Just old. Familiar, even.

They worked side by side, sweeping fallen leaves, setting small dishes of food and sake on the offering table, and lighting sticks of incense. The tasks were simple, repetitive. Aki moved with practiced grace, her sleeves tied back, her hair pinned loosely with a comb someone had loaned her.

"You've done this before," Kaito said after a while.

She nodded. "When I was little. My parents used to bring me to shrines all the time." She paused, placing a small handful of salt at the base of a stone fox statue.

Kaito leaned on the rake, watching her carefully. She caught his gaze and smiled again--soft, bright, the kind of smile that had always made it hard to tell if she was teasing him or not.

For a while, they didn't say much. Just worked in quiet companionship.



They sat on the low stone wall at the edge of the shrine grounds, sharing a small lunch the villagers had packed for them--rice balls, pickled plum, and sweet egg omelet. Aki poured tea from a thermos, handing him a steaming cup.

"It's a nice day," she said, glancing up at the pale blue sky through the canopy.

Kaito sipped his tea, nodding. "Feels... normal."

She chuckled softly. "I was starting to forget what normal felt like."

They sat quietly for a while, eating, drinking, letting the breeze wash over them.

"Hey, Kaito," Aki said after a long pause.

"Hm?"

"Thanks."

He blinked at her. "For what?"

"For... reminding me I don't have to be scared here," she said. "I was really worked up the first night. And now I feel like an idiot."

"You're not an idiot," he said plainly. "You were just worried."

She smiled at him again--genuine, warm--and it did something strange to his chest, something tight and unfamiliar.

"I guess I'm lucky you're here," she added lightly.

He didn't say anything to that. Just finished his tea and set the cup down.

But in his mind, something clicked into place. Maybe Ren was right. Maybe it was time to stop being dense.



After their shift at the shrine ended, they had the rest of the afternoon free. Most of the others had gone back to the dorm or wandered off in pairs. Kaito found himself walking alongside Aki without thinking about it, their steps falling into easy rhythm as they crossed through the village square.

"Want to look around?" he asked.

She nodded. "Sure."

They visited the old weaving workshop first, watching one of the elder women work the loom with patient, practiced hands. Aki admired the dyed threads, fingers brushing over the intricate patterns.

"You could wear something like that," Kaito said absently.

She glanced at him, amused. "I thought you didn't pay attention to clothes."

"I don't," he admitted. "But it'd look good on you."

She blinked. Then smiled--wider, softer, something deeper than before. "Thanks."

Afterward, they stopped by a small garden, sitting on the low wooden fence and sharing a rice cracker Ren had snuck into Kaito's pocket earlier. They fed crumbs to the koi in the pond, watching the fish dart beneath the surface in flashes of orange and white.

It was quiet. Peaceful. Not like school. Not like anything.



As they wandered back toward the dormitory, Aki slowed her pace.

"There's one more place I want to visit," she said, tugging gently at Kaito's sleeve.

He glanced at her hand briefly before nodding. "Where?"

"You'll see."

They took a narrow side path Kaito hadn't noticed before. It wound away from the main village road, past low stone walls and thickets of overgrown flowers that swayed in the breeze. The air was cooler here, shaded by tall cedars. They walked in silence, but it wasn't awkward. Aki's steps were light, almost playful.

At the end of the path stood a small clearing, ringed with mossy stones. In the center was a lone cherry blossom tree, its petals just beginning to bloom even though it was early for the season.

"This is my favorite spot," Aki said quietly.

Kaito stepped closer, tilting his head back to take in the branches spreading above them. "It's nice."

She sat down on one of the stones, patting the spot next to her. He followed without protest, sitting close enough their shoulders brushed. She didn't move away.

"My parents used to bring me here," she said after a moment. "Before they left the village. They said it was a safe place."

Kaito studied her profile, the way the fading light softened her features. She was always calm on the surface--smiling, graceful--but he could sense the weight beneath it. The fear she'd been carrying since they arrived.

But now, she looked... free.

"You really believe in that stuff?" he asked gently.

She gave a faint smile. "I did. Maybe I still do. But today... I don't feel afraid."

Kaito let his hand rest on the stone beside hers. Not touching. Close enough.
"Good."

They sat there as the sky deepened into twilight. The petals above them stirred in the breeze, falling like slow-motion snowflakes. Aki caught one on her palm, studying it as if it held some kind of secret.

"You're different, you know," she said suddenly.

Kaito blinked. "What do you mean?"

"You don't act like anyone else," she said, turning to face him. Her eyes reflected the soft glow of the setting sun. "Most people... they want to run away from things they're afraid of. But you're always so calm. Like nothing can shake you."

He thought about that for a second. "Maybe I'm just lazy."

She laughed softly. "Maybe."

The sound of her laughter settled something inside him.



By the time they returned to the dorm, most of the others were lounging in the common area, playing cards or chatting. Nakajima-senpai was sitting at the table, writing in a thick notebook.

"Where were you two?" Ren asked, raising an eyebrow as he chewed on a rice cracker.

"Exploring," Aki said smoothly before Kaito could answer.

Ren gave them a long look, then smirked. "Uh-huh."

Kaito ignored him. "Dinner?"

Ren stretched. "Your turn."

They moved into the kitchen, where Aki tied on an apron that was definitely too big for her. Kaito grabbed one for himself but made no effort to tie it properly.

"You're hopeless," Aki said, laughing as she reached out and retied the strings behind his neck. Her fingers brushed lightly against his skin, sending a small jolt through him that he tried not to show.

"I cook fine," Kaito muttered.

"Sure you do," she teased. "You're on rice duty."

As they worked, Aki hummed a tune under her breath. She chopped vegetables with practiced ease, smiling to herself. Kaito caught himself watching her more than once, and once or twice she caught him watching, too.

Neither said anything about it.



Dinner was simple--rice, miso soup, grilled fish--but it felt special in its own way. Aki's cooking was praised, and Kaito's rice wasn't terrible (Ren complained anyway). Everyone seemed relaxed. Even Nakajima-senpai lingered longer at the table, listening quietly to the younger students banter.

Afterward, Aki and Kaito washed dishes together. Their hands bumped more than once in the soapy water, and each time they looked at each other, grinning faintly.



Later that night, Kaito found himself on the porch again, leaning against one of the old wooden pillars. The stars were clear, the village quiet except for the occasional soft chirp of crickets.

Aki joined him, sitting beside him without a word.

They sat like that for a while. Comfortable. Close.

"I had fun today," she said softly.

He glanced at her. She was looking up at the sky, but there was a small smile on her lips.

"Yeah," he said. "Me too."

Her hand was close to his again. This time, he let his pinky finger brush against hers. She didn't pull away.

Kaito's lips quirked up slightly. "It was a fun date."

Aki blinked, surprised for a second. Then her face lit up, a soft blush coloring her cheeks. "You're not just saying that?"

He shrugged. "I don't say things I don't mean."

She smiled, brighter than he'd ever seen.
"Well," she said, nudging his shoulder, "you're late. But I'll take it."

He chuckled quietly. "Better late than never."

They sat like that for a while longer, watching the stars. Their fingers intertwined, easy and natural.

-------------------------------x-------------------------------



It was late.

Most of the village had already gone quiet by the time Haruka finished tidying up her home. She stood by the window for a long moment, wiping her hands on the cloth she used for dusting, watching faint trails of mist weave through the narrow paths between the houses. The night air clung to the glass in small beads of moisture, distorting the view beyond.

Inside, it was warm. Familiar. The faint smell of cedar from the old beams mixed with the scent of tea that still lingered from dinner. The house creaked softly in the breeze, but that was nothing new. She had lived here her entire life, in the same old house her grandfather built. Every sound it made was something she'd known since childhood.

And yet, she found herself pausing at the window longer than usual, her reflection faint in the glass. She could see the street. Empty. Silent. Not a soul out this late. Only the faint orange glow from the lanterns left burning in front of the community hall reached this far down the hill.

The village slept.

She let the cloth fall back over the table and moved to gather her papers from where she had been working. Her notes were unfinished. She glanced down at her own handwriting--crisp, neat characters trailing off on the page, leaving a space where her mind had wandered.

That was fine. She could finish them tomorrow.

As Haruka slid the papers into a drawer, she heard it.

A step.

Not outside. Inside.

She turned slowly, standing still in the center of the room. She listened.

Nothing.

She took a slow breath through her nose, held it, and exhaled. She was imagining things. She was tired. Tomorrow was going to be another long day and if she didn't sleep soon, she'd regret it.

She moved quietly, out of habit more than fear, sliding the paper door to the kitchen closed behind her. The old wood groaned faintly under her steps as she crossed the main room, making for the small sleeping space beyond.

Another creak.

This one was not from her.

Haruka's feet stopped moving. The sound had come from further back, near the storeroom. Her brows drew together faintly, and she turned, more annoyed than frightened. The storeroom hadn't been opened in months. What would--

The lights flickered.

Once.

Twice.

Then they steadied again.

She stood there for a long time, watching the overhead bulb. She listened harder. She thought she heard something--a slow scraping sound--but it could have been anything. The old beams shifting, the wind, even one of the neighbors outside.

Still, her fingers lingered on the light switch as she passed, flipping it off and on once. The light held steady.

Nothing wrong.

Haruka shook her head faintly at herself. She was being foolish. She crossed the room and slid open the futon closet, pulling out the blankets and laying them out carefully on the tatami floor. She moved with practiced ease, smoothing out the edges, plumping the pillow. Familiar motions. Comforting.

The creak came again.

This time, it was just outside the paper door behind her.

Haruka froze, fingers still on the pillow.
Then the light went out.

The house plunged into darkness.

Haruka stood motionless for a second, eyes struggling to adjust. She reached for the drawer by the futon and found the matches easily, her fingers knowing the weight of the small box before she even pulled it open. She struck one, the flare of sulfur momentarily blinding, and then lighting the small wick of the candle she kept in the same drawer.

The small flame danced, casting long shadows along the walls. The familiar patterns of wood grain and hanging cloth now looked warped and jagged in the flickering light.

She waited a moment, listening.
Nothing.

Steeling herself, she stood and walked toward the kitchen, candle in hand. The wood underfoot seemed louder now, each step creaking in the silence.

At the kitchen door, she paused again.
She listened.
The scraping sound was back.
Inside the house.

But when she slid the door open, the kitchen was empty. Everything was in its place: the kettle, the wooden bowls stacked neatly by the sink, the cutting board she'd scrubbed clean earlier.
She stepped in, the candle's flame trembling as she passed.

Something cold passed behind her.

She spun.
Nothing.

But the back door of the house had shifted slightly ajar, no breeze explaining its movement.
Haruka walked over to it, pushing it firmly shut and sliding the wooden bolt into place. She kept her hand there for a few seconds, palm flat against the cold wood.
The silence pressed in.

When she turned back, the room felt smaller.
Heavier.
The darkness seemed to press against the thin edge of light from her candle.



As she returned toward the main room, she heard it.
A whisper.
Low, just barely audible, but close enough that she felt it behind her ear.
She turned, candle lifting in her hand.
Nothing.
Only the faint smell of smoke and wax.

She walked faster now.
At the threshold to her sleeping area, she stopped again. The futon was no longer neatly laid out.
The blankets were twisted.
The pillow shifted to the side.

Her throat tightened.
She stepped forward, slow, deliberate.

The candle flickered as if caught in a sudden breath of air.
It dimmed.
Then steadied.

She knelt and smoothed out the blankets again, hands shaking just slightly now.

The whisper came again.
This time, from beneath her.
Or was it above?

Haruka's skin prickled as she stood abruptly, backing away from the futon.

The house creaked.
Then...
A soft patter.
Like footsteps across the ceiling.

She looked up slowly.
The boards overhead were old, worn, but unmoving.

The candle's flame bent sideways, as though a breath had passed over it.
Her fingers tightened on the holder.
Her breath came faster now, shallow, controlled.

And then
A sound.
Breathing.
Not hers.

Directly behind her.



Haruka didn't turn around right away.

She stood still. Frozen. Her grip tightened on the candleholder until her knuckles turned white. She felt a faint warmth against the back of her neck--not warm like breath, but more like... the absence of cold. A presence that shouldn't have been there. Her body told her not to move, to stay perfectly still and quiet.

But her mind refused to listen.

She turned.

There was nothing behind her.

The room was exactly as it had always been--simple, clean, untouched. And yet, something was different. She could feel it. Like walking into a space where someone had just been. Like the air hadn't had time to cool yet.

The flame flickered again, almost rhythmically.
Once.
Twice.
Three times.

She turned toward the main doorway leading to the front entrance.
Her feet carried her without thought, the old floorboards soft and familiar underfoot. She slid the door open with slow, careful hands, not sure what she expected.
But the entryway was empty.

No shoes out of place. No door ajar.
Nothing.

She stepped back inside, sliding the door shut.
The sound of it closing seemed louder than it should have been.

Haruka took a deep breath and moved back toward the futon. She knelt down slowly, setting the candle beside her. It cast a faint, warm glow over the woven tatami mats. She pressed her palms against her knees, grounding herself. She told herself to breathe.

Everything was fine.

The house was old. It made noises. That's all it was.
That's all it had ever been.

The whisper came again.

Soft. Close.
"...come..."

She jerked her head up, heart pounding in her ears.
The candle's flame began to twist and stretch unnaturally, as if being pulled by something unseen.

And then it went out.




Haruka was left in perfect darkness.

She scrambled to grab the matches again, hands fumbling over the smooth floorboards. She struck one. It flared briefly--then died.
Another.
Nothing.

Her breathing grew faster, her chest tight, the room pressing in on all sides. It was a silence so absolute it felt alive.
She forced herself to move.

Hands out in front of her, she stood and walked toward where she thought the door was. Her palms pressed flat against paper and wood, but as she slid them across the surface, something changed.
The texture.
It wasn't wood anymore. It felt... soft. Like skin. Cold and dry.

She yanked her hand back in an instant, stumbling away from the wall, breathing shallow, fast, panicked.

A faint sound drifted through the dark.

Footsteps.

Inside the house.
Close.
Coming toward her.

They stopped.

Then another sound.
A scratching. Slow. Deliberate.

Haruka backed up until her heels hit something solid. The low table. She sank to the floor, trying to make herself smaller, quieter. Her pulse pounded in her throat.

She heard the footsteps again. Not walking.
Circling.

There was a faint shift in the air pressure. Something drawing closer.
Breathing.
And then the faintest sensation--something brushing against her cheek. Cold. Smooth.
Fingers?

"NO!!!"
She swatted at the air instinctively, striking nothing.

She stood, bolting toward the kitchen without thinking.
Her feet slapped against the wooden planks as she ran, heart hammering in her chest. She reached the kitchen doorway and slid it open in one frantic motion.

The candle was on the counter.
Unlit.

She grabbed it, hands shaking violently now.
Another match.
She struck it.

This time, it caught.
The flame trembled, weak but holding.

The candle's soft glow returned, faintly illuminating the kitchen. Haruka's breath came in short, shallow gasps as her eyes locked onto the back door.

It was wide open.

The cold night air seeped through the doorway like a creeping fog, brushing past her skin. For a brief, blinding moment, relief surged through her chest.

Escape.

She didn't think. She didn't hesitate.

She ran.

Her bare feet slapped against the wooden planks as she bolted for the door, candle clenched tightly in her trembling hand. The flame jerked violently as she moved, but she didn't care. She just needed to get out.

Closer.
Closer.

And then the door--
Slammed.

Violently.
So hard the floor shook beneath her feet.

Haruka skidded to a stop, heart slamming against her ribs.
She stood there, staring at the door, her pulse roaring in her ears.

The bolt slid back into place.
By itself.
With a slow, grinding sound.

For a few seconds, she couldn't move. Couldn't breathe.

The flame on the candle guttered wildly again, as though reacting to her fear.
She took a step back.
Then another.
And then something scraped softly behind her.

She spun, candle lifting instinctively.

The room was empty.
Nothing moved.
But the shadows seemed to stretch longer now, pooling like liquid along the floorboards.

Haruka's throat was tight, her breath coming sharp and uneven. She turned back toward the door, trying the bolt. It didn't budge. She slammed her palm against the wood once, twice--desperate.

"Let me out," she whispered, voice hoarse.

The door wouldn't budge.

Haruka shoved her weight against it again, both hands flat on the rough wood, but it was no use. The bolt, which had slid so easily before, now felt like it was fused into place. She kicked at the bottom of the door, the sound echoing through the house like a hollow drumbeat.

No answer.
No movement.
Just the dull ache of futility gnawing at her ribs.

The candle flame trembled as she backed away, her pulse pounding in time with the flickering light.

There were other ways out.
There had to be.

She turned sharply and made for the window in the kitchen. The latch clicked open under her fingers, but when she pushed, the frame wouldn't move. She pushed harder, using her shoulder, trying to force it.

Nothing.
It didn't budge.

She could feel the cold glass under her palm, slick with condensation. The house was holding its breath.

Haruka gritted her teeth, took a step back, and swung the candleholder toward the glass, ready to break it.

But her arm froze.

Her body refused to move.

For one terrible second, she felt something tighten around her wrist--
Nothing visible.
But it was there.
And it was holding her still.

Her breath caught in her throat. The pressure vanished as quickly as it came, leaving her arm tingling and weak. She stumbled back from the window, candle clenched tightly in her opposite hand.

The flame fluttered dangerously low.

She turned toward the hallway, moving quickly now. Her feet whispered over the tatami mats as she hurried through the main room. She reached the front door and grasped the old brass handle.

The door felt cold.

Colder than anything else in the house.

She twisted the handle.
It moved.
A sliver of hope surged through her chest as she pulled.

The door didn't open.

She pulled harder.
It resisted, groaning like an old tree in the wind.

She put her shoulder against it and pushed, but the door refused to yield.
Her breath quickened, panic clawing up her spine.

Haruka pounded against the wood with her fist.
"Help!"
Her voice cracked in the silence.
"Someone! Help me!"

The house didn't answer.
But something else did.

A faint sound--barely audible--slithered through the air behind her.
Breathing.
Wet.
Close.

She turned.
Nothing.
The candle flame twisted sideways again, pulled by something unseen.

And then the voices began.

Soft whispers curled through the air.
At first, they sounded like wind.
But they weren't.

They were words.
Spoken in a language she didn't understand.
Low and rhythmic.
Like chanting.

Haruka pressed her back to the door, candle raised high.
The whispers grew louder, shifting direction, as though something circled her in the dark.

And then
"Haruka,"
A voice spoke her name.

She didn't recognize it.
It was wrong.
The way it bent her name into something else.
Too many syllables.
Too slow.

The candle flickered again, bowing low.

She stepped away from the door, retreating toward the center of the room. Her knees shook with every step.

She heard footsteps.
Soft. Bare.
Across the tatami.
Coming closer.

She spun.
Nothing.

Again.
Closer this time.

The candle dimmed.
The whispers grew louder, filling her ears until she couldn't hear her own ragged breathing.

And then it all stopped.

Silence.

The candle flame steadied.
Just for a moment.

And then
It went out.

Not blown out.
Not snuffed.

It simply ceased to be.
One second it was there.
The next, nothing.

The dark was immediate.
Absolute.
Crushing.

Haruka froze, her body locked in place, terror pinning her where she stood.

She felt it then.
Breath on her skin.
A weight behind her, close enough to touch.

And then something did.

Cold fingers--impossibly long, impossibly thin--brushed the side of her neck.
They pressed gently at first, as if testing.
Then harder.
Tightening.

Her breath stopped.

She couldn't move.
Couldn't scream.
Couldn't think.

The world went still.

And then--
